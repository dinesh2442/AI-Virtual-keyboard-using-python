# AI-Virtual-keyboard-using-python
Since the development of computer technology, human interaction with computers has evolved. Gestures are an effective method to interact also the era of Covid-19 impacted on us. The keyboard devices that interact with computers. Here we have tried to make the keyboard feature interaction using hand gestures. Eventually discarding the electronic equipment. Hence, the typing on a virtual keyboard. The typing data will be carried out using various hand gestures. The IOT device needed to achieve this is a webcam. The camera's output will be presented on the system's screen so that the user can further calibrate it. We use technologies like Open-CV, Media-Pipe, PyAutoGUI, Python. The Media-Pipe library comes in very handy in AI projects and provides features that help the modelâ€™s efficiency. The user will be able to type using the virtual keyboard. In this paper, we propose a hand gesture recognition system to typing on the virtual mouse and a virtual keyboard for natural human computer interface.
